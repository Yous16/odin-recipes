    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Flan is a popular Spanish dessert and different regions make different versions. It is essentially a custard dessert made by combining eggs, milk, sugar (or condensed milk), and vanilla and it is baked in a water bath similar to the way a Cheesecake is baked. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Condensed milk</li>
            <li>Evaporated milk</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep – Because the caramel sets quickly, you want to have a 9″ x 2″ round cake pan out and ready for use. Also, preheat the oven to 350˚F and bring a kettle of water to boil.</li>
            <li>Make the Caramel – In a saucepan, combine water and sugar and bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. As soon as it starts to change color, start swirling the pan. Once it’s the color of cinnamon, take it off the heat and swirl it for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour melted sugar into your cake pan and immediately tilt the pan to coat the bottom (be careful the pan will get hot!).</li>
            <li>Make the Custard – Combine the custard ingredients in a blender and blend on low speed for 1 minute. Strain through a sieve lined with cheesecloth (to reduce the bubbles) and pour over your caramel layer.</li>
            <li>Cover the cake pan with foil and set the pan inside of a large roasting pan then set the roasting pan in your oven. Pour hot water into the roasting pan, about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 for 70-80 minutes or until there is just a slight jiggle in the center. Remove from oven, uncover, transfer to a rack, and cool to room temperature then cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>To Serve – Run a knife around the edges of the cake pan. Set the cake on a rimmed platter and invert the cake onto the platter. Tap the cake pan until you feel it dislodging then lift the cake pan off the cake.</li>
        </ol>
