    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Also known as French butter cakes, madeleines are well-known, easily-recognizable, sophisticated little cakes. They have a reputation for being fussy, and what they’re really known for is their scalloped shell-shape and their characteristic bump. It took weeks upon weeks to finally get this recipe perfected, but it was definitely worth it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50g butter, melted but cool, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>50g caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp honey</li>
            <li>50g self-raising flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 210C/190C fan/gas 6½ and butter eight holes of a madeleine tin (if you have a six-hole tin you'll need to bake in two batches). Beat the egg, sugar and honey together using an electric whisk until pale, fluffy and tripled in volume. Add the flour and a small pinch of salt, and finally mix in the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Spoon the mixture into the buttered holes of the madeleine tin and bake for 8-10 mins or until puffed up and golden. Turn out onto a cooling rack while you cook a second batch if using a smaller tin. Best eaten warm from the oven but will keep in an airtight container for up to two days.</li>
        </ol>
